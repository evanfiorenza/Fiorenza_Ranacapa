## Welcome to ranacapa

Hi there! This app is designed to help explore biodiversity using results from environmental DNA (eDNA) analyses. Click the buttons above to navigate between visualizations and exploratory analyses. The app comes with a Demo dataset that you can use to get a sense of the types of information you can explore. Once you explore the app using the demo dataset, we encourage you to explore your own eDNA data by uploading a taxonomy and metadata table on the "Data Import" tab.
